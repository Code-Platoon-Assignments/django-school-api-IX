# School API VIII

By the end of this assignment you will have a fully serviceable CRUD API with user authentication capabilities that will allow School staff to easily manage students and scholastic equipment.

## School API Front End

In this assignment you will construct a Vite + React.js Front-End application that will communicate with the Django School API to generate a friendly user interface.

## Tasks

- Add the field `id` to your Student Django Serializer
- Create a HomePage.jsx that will give users a welcome message to your school portal
- Create a SubjectsPage.jsx that will give users all information matching the Django API response from `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/subjects/` with a link to each individual subject.
- Create an ASubjectPage.jsx that will give users all information matching the Django API response from `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/subjects/<str:subject>/`.
- Create a StudentsPage.jsx that will give users all information matching the Django API response from `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/students/` with a link to each individual student.
- Create an AStudentPage.jsx that will give users all information matching the Django API response from `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/students/<int:id>/`.
- Create and Connect a Browser Router to your React Application to render each page on their own route.
- Create and Connect a Navigation Bar to give users the ability to move between pages
